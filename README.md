# linked-list

A **really** simple linked list implementation in C++, mostly just written to understand how linked lists work.

Currently, just loads a txt file into a linked list, then querys the user to enter a word to find.

## Compiling

### Dependencies

* cmake
* make
* g++

1. Make a build folder

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

2. Generate CMake files

```
$ cmake ..
```

3. Compile

```
$ make
```

4. Run the binary

```
$ bin/LinkedList.o <PATH_TO_TXT_FILE>
```

>Since this was mostly a demo project, there is little to no error checking in places where there should be.
